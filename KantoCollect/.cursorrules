# MANDATORY TESTING RULES - DO NOT SKIP

## CRITICAL: TEST AFTER EVERY CHANGE
After ANY code modification, the AI MUST:
1. **ASK THE USER**: "Should I test this change now? (yes/no)"
2. **WAIT FOR RESPONSE** before proceeding
3. **IF YES**: Run the appropriate test immediately
4. **IF TEST FAILS**: Revert the change with `git checkout HEAD -- <file>` before trying again

## Testing Methods (choose appropriate one):
- **Backend API**: `curl` the endpoint directly
- **Frontend UI**: Use browser tools to navigate and take screenshot
- **Python code**: Run `pytest` or direct Python execution
- **Database**: Query with SQLite/psql

## NEVER:
- Say "this should work" without testing
- Assume a fix works
- Make multiple changes before testing
- Skip testing because "it's a simple change"

## Git Workflow:
- Commit after EACH working change
- If something breaks, revert immediately: `git checkout HEAD~1 -- .`
- Always have a working commit to fall back to

## When User Reports Error:
1. First check server logs
2. Then check the actual code that was changed
3. Test the specific failure case
4. Only then propose a fix
